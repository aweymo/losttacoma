    <p>William Mallis was born in Auchterarder, Scotland and received architectural training during a four year apprenticeship in Perth, Scotland. After working under John H. Felt, one of the most prolific school designers in Kansas, Mallis moved to Seattle in 1918 and worked as a structural draftsman for the Pacific Coast Company. From that point, Mallis worked independently as well as a partner with Joseph H.D. DeHart on a wide variety of public institutional buildings across Washington State.</p>
